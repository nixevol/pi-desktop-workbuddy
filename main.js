 * pi-desktop-workbuddy - PI-Desktop plugin entry.

 * PI-Desktop port of `dsh-workbuddy-xdpool` (MIT). Same behaviour as the
 * original, rewritten against the PI-Desktop plugin host:
 *
 *   1. discover EVERY WorkBuddy desktop sign-in on this machine (read-only),
 *   2. serve each gateway (domestic / international) from its own loopback
 *      OpenAI-compatible endpoint,
 *   3. publish those endpoints as two providers in this plugin's own manifest
 *      (`contributes.providers`) - the only provider channel the host exposes,
 *   4. rotate to the next account whenever the upstream answers 429.
 *
 * The host spawns plugins in a Node utility process with a stripped
 * environment, so every path is rebuilt from the home directory rather than
 * from %LOCALAPPDATA%/APPDATA% (see lib/accounts.js).
 *
 * Upstream traffic uses the platform `fetch` in that process rather than the
 * host's `net.fetch` bridge: the bridge buffers a response into text, and the
 * provider contract needs the upstream SSE body relayed as it arrives. Nothing
 * leaves this machine except to WorkBuddy's own endpoints.
