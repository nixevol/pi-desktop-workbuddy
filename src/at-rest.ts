/**
 * WorkBuddy desktop "at-rest" credential decryption.
 *
 * From 5.6.0 the WorkBuddy desktop app no longer stores `auth.accessToken` /
 * `auth.refreshToken` as plain strings. It writes a field wrapper:
 *
 *   { "$wbEncrypted": 1, "envelope": "<base64 of a JSON envelope>" }
 *
 * where the envelope is `{suite, keyId, nonce, authTag, ciphertext}` for
 * AES-256-GCM with a 12-byte nonce and a 16-byte tag. The authenticated
 * additional data is a length-prefixed transcript over the scheme, suite,
 * keyId and framing, so the ciphertext can only be opened for the exact field
 * shape it was sealed for.
 *
 * The field key itself is NOT a user secret: it is a build-time constant
 * compiled into the app's own Electron native module
 * (`electron_browser_workbuddy_storage`). The app fetches it through
 * `loggerGet()` and hashes the returned base64 STRING (not the decoded bytes)
 * to obtain the 32-byte key; `keyId` is the first 16 hex characters of that
 * key's SHA-256.
 *
 * This module re-derives the same key by asking the installed app for the same
 * payload, and caches it in memory for the process lifetime. Nothing is ever
 * written to disk, and the payload is never logged.
 *
 * 溯源：本文件移植自 dingminhua/dsh-connect-workbuddy 的 src/at-rest.ts
 *   （MIT，Copyright (c) 2026 LaoDing）——该模块最先定位并修复了「5.6.0 起
 *   macOS 与 Windows 同样加密凭据」这一问题（其 issue #15 真机取证）。移植时
 *   保留其全部判定逻辑（CFBundleExecutable 向 bundle 自己问、按 bundle id
 *   确认身份后才 exec、field framing 的 AAD 转录、keyId 校验），未作改动。
 *
 * 改动：**「macOS 也加密」这一事实**（issue #15 真机取证）。本模块原先假设该
 *   policy 是 Windows 先行、macOS 只是「将来可能」，于是 macOS 的可执行文件
 *   路径用 App 名拼成 `<bundle>/Contents/MacOS/WorkBuddy`——而两个真实 bundle
 *   的 `CFBundleExecutable` 都是 `Electron`，该路径并不存在。结果是 macOS 上
 *   加密凭据**永远**取不到密钥，用户却被报成「未登录」。现在二进制名向 bundle
 *   自己问（`macosBundleExecutable()`），候选含国际版 `WorkBuddy AI.app`，
 *   并允许 App 被归入 applications 目录的子目录——扫到的候选必须先用
 *   `CFBundleIdentifier` 确认身份才 `execFile`，因为**每个 Electron 应用的
 *   二进制都叫 `Electron`**，只按名字匹配就可能启动另一个产品。
